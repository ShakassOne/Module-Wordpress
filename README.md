# Module-Wordpress V1.1

This plugin provides the basic WinShirt admin area. Version 1.1 introduces a simple mockup generator that lets you create color variations from a single PNG image.

## Mockup Generator

1. Upload a neutral PNG (transparent background) in the **Mockup Generator** submenu.
2. Enter one or more HEX colors separated by comma or space.
3. The preview area displays canvases tinted with each color, allowing quick creation of colour variants without generating multiple images.
